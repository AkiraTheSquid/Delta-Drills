# Responding to the HOA Lawsuit

- **Deadline to Answer:**  In Texas you must file a written Answer by 10:00 AM on the Monday after 20 days from service【29†L191-L194】.  If you were served in early February, count 20 days on a calendar (including weekends) and then go to the next Monday.  If you miss that deadline, the HOA can obtain a *default judgment* without any further notice【29†L198-L201】.  (Filing the Answer is free【25†L162-L166】, but you must still serve a copy on the HOA or its attorney.) 

- **File a Written Answer (General Denial):**  By Monday, file an “Original Answer” or “General Denial.”  In it, **deny every allegation** (requesting that the HOA prove its case)【27†L69-L71】.  For example, you might state “Defendant denies each and every, all and singular, allegation in Plaintiff’s petition and demands strict proof.”  Then specifically address the mold claim: say you never received any written notice or “Exhibit” about mold and deny having any mold-related violation.  Include any legal defenses.  For example, Texas law (Prop. Code § 209.006) requires an HOA to send *written notice by certified mail* describing the violation and give 30 days to cure it before suing【16†L73-L81】【13†L267-L270】.  If you never got that notice or cure opportunity, say so as an affirmative defense. 

- **Answer Contents:**  Your Answer should include:  
  - A **general denial** asking the court to make the HOA prove every claim【27†L69-L71】.  
  - **Specific denials** of key facts (e.g. “Defendant specifically denies receiving any notice or communication about mold at 207 Magic Oaks” and “Defendant denies the facts in the attached Exhibit A”).  
  - Any **affirmative defenses**: e.g., “Plaintiff failed to comply with Texas Property Code §209.006 (no written notice or cure period)”.  
  - A **conclusion/prayer** asking the court to deny the HOA’s relief.  

- **Serve and File:**  File the Answer with the court clerk by Monday 10:00 AM and *serve* a copy on the HOA or its lawyer (via mail, fax, or hand delivery)【27†L87-L90】.  Keep proof of service.  Once filed, the court will notify you of any hearing dates (you do not need to appear on Monday unless the judge tells you to).

- **Gather Evidence:**  After answering, you can demand the HOA’s evidence.  Texas law (§ 209.005) lets homeowners inspect HOA records【13†L324-L326】.  Use *discovery requests* (Requests for Production, Interrogatories, etc.) to obtain all correspondence, notices, emails, or “exhibits” about the alleged mold.  Ask specifically for the document(s) labeled “Exhibit A” and any proof the HOA claims it gave you mold notices.  If the HOA didn’t give you the Exhibit, note that in your Answer and request it formally.  Getting these records can show whether any valid notice was actually sent.

- **Consider Mediation or ADR:**  Texas encourages alternative dispute resolution in HOA cases【13†L328-L332】.  You might offer or agree to mediation with the HOA, especially if you want to avoid court.  If the HOA won’t talk, proceed with litigation steps. 

- **Consult an Attorney (if possible):**  Though legal costs are a concern, even a short attorney consultation can help clarify your options【29†L130-L134】.  Many Texas lawyers offer brief paid or free “quick consults.”  If you truly cannot afford one, consider contacting Lone Star Legal Aid or the Texas Bar’s lawyer-referral programs for low-cost help.  At minimum, be careful not to waive any rights (e.g. if you live out of state, see TexasLawHelp on special appearances【29†L147-L155】).  

- **Remember the Stakes:**  If you do nothing, the HOA will likely win by default and get the injunction and fines it asks for.  By answering, you force the HOA to prove its case.  From here you’ll exchange evidence (through discovery) and prepare for a hearing.  Stay organized: keep copies of everything.  Your main early task is meeting the Monday deadline with a complete written Answer (general denial plus any defenses)【27†L69-L71】【29†L191-L194】.
